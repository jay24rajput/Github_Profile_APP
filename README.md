# Github_Profile_APP
An app that gives the details of an user when a github username is typed.

## Basic features to be implemented
* A basic app in Kotlin
* A basic layout to take input username 
  * Must create fragments (MainActivity should be the only activity present and it would be the base of all the other fragments that would be created later)
* Implementation of the API call using retrofit
* Show the user data properly in a fragment
